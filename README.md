### Who am I? 👨🏻‍🚀


Hi, my name is Lautaro Mazzitelli and I’m a Software Engineer. Team player in different roles. Developer, Coach, Facilitator, Public Speaker, University Teacher, Product person.

Most of the projects that I worked on in my professional career can be read on [my linkedin profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/lmazzitelli). Regarding code, most of what I produced is owned by my previous employers and unfortunately it’s not open source (in fact, it’s private code). Still you can find projects or contributions that I worked on on this profile.
